Description: An Irish Verb Conjugator, made using non-relational supported Django and Python 2. Shows both standard
and non-standard forms so that learner's will be able to recognize it no matter 

Instructions on how to get non-relational supported Django, see [here](https://django-mongodb-engine.readthedocs.org/en/latest/topics/setup.html)

This project **is not** complete yet, and still needs styling work done (any aesthetic ideas are more than welcome)

However, with that said, it is unlikely this iteration will ever be publically deployed, as it was designed to teach me 
how to make an app using Django only. A newer version will be created after I am finished using Django REST
framework and a JavaScript framework (likely Angular).
